# gluehwein-planer
A simple tool that allows the planning, simulation and saving of structrures placed in an city-enviroment.
# Current State
Currently the tool only allows the simulating of events in the centre of Leipzig. 
Also only 1 model for an structure, a point to which agents seek, is in use. 
Also the number of agents in the scene are limited to about 1800 agents due to the Navmesh plugin.
